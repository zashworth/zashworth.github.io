        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <p>
            Apple 
        </p>

        <p>
            Apple show great use of white space all over their website. They are known for a very athstetically pleasing website. You can see that the products
            are all centered with lots of white space all around and between products. It allows the eyes to focus on the products. This helps greatly with
            product sales.

        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

        <img src="images/gethushinruleofthirds.PNG" alt="Get Hushin Website picture showing rule of thirds while holding elk backstrap">
        <p>
            In this image that Hush uses on thier website you can see that the rule of thirds is used here and it really increases the beauty of the shot. 
            You can see one of the team members on teh right hand side in only about a third of the picture but then you nave the body of an elk laying accross
            the other two-thirds of the picture. It looks more pleasing then if he was standing in the middle.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p>
           Bennie's Corner
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.benniescorner.com">www.benniescorner.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/benniescorneralignment.PNG" alt="Bennie's Corner website showing alignment with page options">
        <p>
            You can see the principle of alignment being used on Bennie's Corner with these page boxes and also the product placement on the page, which is 
            not shown. But the alignment keeps the boxes the same width and the same distance from each other making it look good and flow nicely. It also
            gives the webpage a sense of simplicity.
